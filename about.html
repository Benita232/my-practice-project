       <h2>&#10024 About Me &#10024  </h2>
         <p>Hello! I’m Ms. Nnabuife Benita, an aspiring web developer with a strong passion for creativity, problem-solving, and innovation. After years of experience in administration, marketing, and customer service, I’ve taken a bold step to transition into the world of tech—where ideas become interactive and possibilities are endless.

Currently enrolled in the FNB Academy, I’m learning to build responsive, user-friendly websites from the ground up. This Avengers-themed site is one of my first assignments, created to showcase my growing skills in HTML, CSS, and the fundamentals of web development.

Just like the Avengers, I believe that with determination, teamwork, and the right tools, we can build powerful things—and I’m excited to be on this new journey!

Stay tuned—this is just the beginning.</p>
